# External-LAN Access

![alt text](img/paste-1756382727862.png)

---

# External-LAN Access

- CMU `gateway` (`router`) would not allow it.
  - Security
- Even if CMU `gateway` allows it, there is still a shared public-IP problem.

---

# Test Connectivity - `ping`

- `ping google.com` (working)
- Trying `ping` your computer's public IP.

---

# DNS

- _Domain Name System_
- Internet protocol that translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 93.184.216.34)
- `dig google.com`

---

# Server with Public IP

---

# Test Server Connection

- Can you find out what the ip address is?

---

# Same Problem

---

# VPN

- Virtual Private Network
- Technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet
  - Allowing private network access from remote or public locations.
- As if computers are in the same LAN.
